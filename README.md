# Hi Stranger, welcome on my GitHub 👋

But _who am I_ ? 🤨 My name is **Samuel Letocart** (for those who speak french, yes it is my real name) and I live in **Liège, Belgium**. I'm a 24y.o. **developper** currently finishing my learning [BeCode](https://becode.org/fr/) and I also have got a bachelor's degree in **3D computer graphics**.

### Wanna dive in my Repo's ? 🏊‍♂️

**Before you dive in :** 


My repo's are divided in **2** main categories, first the personnal projects, than the repositories of my training at BeCode. Some of them are old and far from perfect **but** as I started my first commits in January 2021 you can see the evolution between then and now. I'm a fast learner and have good adaptation abilities and these repositories shows you a bit how I can evolve !
